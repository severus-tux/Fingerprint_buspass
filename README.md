# Fingerprint_buspass

 - Review Video : https://youtu.be/jSzUHH_sWx0

This project aims to replace the traditional bus-pass system by implementing a finger print based system.

## How this works ?

The passenger is required to register his fingerprint through an online application. When the documents are verified, hi/she can just use their fingerprint as a bus pass. Everything conductor asks for pass, passenger gives the fingerprint. The conductor/ticket collector will be having a device capable of getting fingerprint from passenger and instantly verify the validity of it by connecting to a server.

The passenger can even buy a daily pass on the bus. Just giving the fee and fingerprint, conductor registers the passenger's fingerprint for the day. The passenger can now hop on to any bus and his fingerprint will be valid for the whole day.

This project overcomes the following existing problems :

 - Forgetting  bus pass
 - Forgetting ID card
 - Problems in getting a bus pass ( waiting in queue )
 - Illegal transfer of bus pass
 - Difficulty in verifying a bus pass .
